üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Ayushranjan11/ai-seo-blog-generator.git
cd ai-seo-blog-generator

2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment
This creates an isolated space for the project's packages.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Python Packages
This command installs all the necessary libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure API Keys
Copy the example environment file to create your own secret file:

cp env.example .env

Open the newly created .env file with a text editor and add your secret API keys from SerpApi and Google AI Studio.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
To generate a new blog post, run the script from your terminal with a product query. Make sure your virtual environment is active.

Examples:
# For tech products
python create_blog.py --query "best noise cancelling headphones"

# For home goods
python create_blog.py --query "top rated air fryers"

The script will generate a .md file in the project directory. You can then copy its content and paste it directly into your blog.
